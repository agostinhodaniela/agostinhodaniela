                        <i>Fleshing Out the Image</i> is a collaborative artistic project that explores the biopolitics
                        of image-making and the sensorial and political materiality of visual and sonic technologies.
                        The project brings into dialogue phenomenological reflections on embodiment and moving image
                        culture with conceptualizations of enfleshment as a mode of power and capture but also of
                        possibilities for sensual and political refusal. <br><br>

                        Fleshing out the Image investigates the sensorial engagement with visual-sonic worlds as
                        “fleshed out”, as grounded in embodied experiences “of material enworldedness, orientation,
                        movement, seeing, hearing, and reflection”, as film theorist Vivian Sobchack suggests. Inspired
                        by thinkers such as Hortense Spillers, Alexander Ghedi Weheliye, Amber Jamilla Musser and Tina
                        Campt, the project explores the politics of sensorial engagement by foregrounding the flesh as a
                        site of both violence and possibility, as an experience that objectifies but also potentially
                        conjures political imaginaries of refusal and adjacency, an experience of being-with which is
                        accessible through the sensual. <br><br>

                        <i>Fleshing out the Image</I> thus inquires into the visual-sonic experience as both embodied
                        and embodying, as grounded in the multisensoriality of the embodied encounter with cinematic
                        technologies, and as constitutive of bodies, subjects and ethical orientations. <br><br>

                        The programme consists of an artistic and curatorial residency in Porto; the exhibition project
                        “Chamber”, on view at the Carlos Alberto Chapel in Porto; and a lecture series entitled
                        “Fleshing out the Image: Pleasure and Refusal in Contemporary Aesthetics” which will be made
                        available on this website throughout November and December 2020. Speakers in the series include
                        Tina Campt, Alexander Ghedi Weheliye, Amber Jamilla Musser, Tavia Nyong’o, Zakiyyah Iman Jackson
                        and Denise Ferreira da Silva.

                        The lecture series <i>Fleshing out the Image: Pleasure and Refusal in Contemporary
                            Aesthetics</i> seeks to explore the potential of enfleshment as a mode of sensual and
                        political refusal. The series homes in on the role of the senses – understood as the sensorial
                        engagement with visual-sonic-tactile worlds as well as a realignment of the field of aesthetics
                        – in the creation of imaginaries of refusal and ways of living otherwise.
                        <br> <br>
                        The first session features a talk by Amber Jamilla Musser, followed by conversation with Tavia
                        Nyong’o. In this talk, Musser expands her thinking on “brown jouissance” through an engagement
                        with the work of visual artist Jacolby Satterwhite. Reading Satterwhite’s curation of his
                        mother’s work as a “maternal elsewhere”, Musser proposes to read his practice through noise, as
                        “an elsewhere that offers a form of adjacency and which is accessible through the sensual”.
                        <br> <br>
                        The second session presents a talk by Zakiyyah Iman Jackson, followed by a dialogue with Denise
                        Ferreira da Silva. The talk draws on Sylvia Wynter’s essay “Rethinking ‘Aesthetics’: Notes
                        towards Decipherment” to reexamine the meaning of aesthetics and challenge the continuities
                        between the culture of literary, film, and art criticism and the culture of the gene in the
                        biological sciences.
                        <br> <br>
                        The final session features a talk by Tina Campt, followed by a conversation with Alexander Ghedi
                        Weheliye. Tina Campt’s talk will explore what she terms “practices of refusal” enacted by Black
                        contemporary artists who use negation as a generative and creative source of disorderly power to
                        embrace the possibility of living otherwise”.

                            Amber Jamilla Musser</b> is an Associate Professor of American Studies at George
                            Washington University. Her research is at the intersection of aesthetics, race, gender, and
                            sexuality studies. Dr. Musser has also published widely on race and critical theory, queer
                            femininities and race, race and sexuality, and queer of color critique. She is particularly
                            interested in thinking about what constitutes the flesh. Her first book, <i>Sensational
                                Flesh: Race, Power, and Masochism</i> (New York University Press, 2014), uses masochism
                            as a lens to theorize different felt relationships to power. Her second book <i>Sensual
                                Excess: Queer Femininity and Brown Jouissance</i> (New York University Press, 2018),
                            which received a 2018 Arts Writer’s Grant from the Warhol Foundation, turns toward sensation
                            and aesthetics in order to imagine epistemologies of sensuality that emerge from fleshiness.
                            She also coedited, along with Kadji Amin and Roy Pérez, <i>Queer Form: Aesthetics, Race, and
                                the Violences of the Social</i>, a special issue of <I>ASAP/Journal</i> (May 2017).
                            Currently, she is beginning a project on noise, ethics, and aesthetics. She also writes art
                            reviews for <i>Brooklyn Rail</i>.

                            <b>Tavia Nyong’o</b> is Chair and Professor of Theater & Performance Studies, Professor of
                            American Studies, and Professor of African-American Studies at Yale University. His current
                            research and teaching interests span black queer cultural and performance studies,
                            contemporary art and aesthetic theory, speculative genres, afrofuturism, and black sound
                            studies. Nyong’o’s first book, <i>The Amalgamation Waltz: Race, Performance, and the Ruses
                                of Memory</i> (2009) won the Errol Hill award for the best book in black theater and
                            performance studies. His second book, <i>Afro-Fabulations: The Queer Drama of Black Life</i>
                            (2018) won the Barnard Hewitt award for best book in theater and performance studies. He
                            edits the <i>Sexual Cultures</i> book series at NYU Press with Ann Pellegrini and Joshua
                            Chambers-Letson. Nyong’o also writes for contemporary art and culture publications such as
                            <i>Artforum</i>, <i>Texte Zur Kunst</i>, <I>Cabinet</i>, <I>n+1</i>, <I>NPR</i>, and the
                            <i>LA Review of Books</i>. In 2019, he curated “Dark as the Door to a Dream” at the
                            Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, as part of the Studium Generale Rietveld Academie. In 2017,

                            <b>Zakiyyah Iman Jackson</b> is an Assistant Professor of English at the University of
                            Southern California. Her research explores the literary and figurative aspects of Western
                            philosophical and scientific discourse and investigates the engagement of African diasporic
                            literature and visual culture with the historical concerns, knowledge claims, and rhetoric
                            of Western science and philosophy. She is the author of <i>Becoming Human: Matter and
                                Meaning in an Antiblack World</i> (New York University Press, 2020). <i>Becoming
                                Human</i> argues that key African American, African, and Caribbean literary and visual
                            texts generate conceptions of being and materiality that creatively disrupt a human-animal
                            distinction that persistently reproduces the racial logics and orders of Western thought.
                            These texts move beyond a critique of bestialization to generate new possibilities for
                            rethinking ontology: our being, fleshly materiality, and the nature of what exists and what
                            we can claim to know about existence. Jackson is at work on a second book, tentatively
                            titled “Obscure Light: Blackness and the Derangement of Sex-Gender.” She has published in
                            <i>Feminist Studies</i>; <i>Qui Parle: Critical Humanities and Social Science</i>;

                            University where he teaches black literature and culture, critical theory, social
                            technologies, and popular culture. He is the author of <i>Phonographies: Grooves in Sonic
                                Afro-Modernity</i> (2005) and <i>Habeas Viscus: Racializing Assemblages, Biopolitics,

                            projects. The first, <i>Feenin: R&B’s Technologies of Humanity</i>, offers a critical
                            history of the intimate relationship between R&B music and technology since the late 1970s.
                            The second, <i>Black Life/SchwarzSein</i>, situates Blackness as an ungendered ontology of
                            unbelonging.<br><br>

                        “Chamber” is an exhibition project by visual artist Igor Jesus in collaboration with Daniela
                        Agostinho and Ana Cristina Cachola. The project consists of an exhibition, held at the Carlos
                        Alberto Chapel in Porto, and a sound library created by the artist and made available on this
                        website.<br><br>
                        The exhibition presents a series of works that explores the phonic substance of moving images.
                        Through a technological metabolism in which photosensitive cells generate a sound-making
                        process, “Chamber” turns the space of the chapel into a resonance chamber that interacts with
                        the surrounding and changing light conditions. The project departs from Igor Jesus’s research
                        into the sonic legacy of Drexciya, the electronic music duo from Detroit, whose sonic universe
                        and underwater imaginary are materialized in the exhibition in the form of an organism (both
                        audiovisual and sculptural) through which image and sound transfigure one another. The audio
                        project traces the reappearance of Drexciya’s tracks in numerous techno tracks by different
                        artists to explore the mutations of their sonic afterlife. The project is interested in
                        exploring the generative capacity of this submersive sonic atmosphere, the ways in which it
                        resurfaces and lives on in new habitats, and the modes of attunement and being-with that it can
                        give rise to.
