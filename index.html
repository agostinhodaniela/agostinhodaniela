                <i>Fleshing Out the Image</i> is a collaborative artistic project that explores the biopolitics of image-making and the sensorial and political materiality of visual and sonic technologies.
The project brings into dialogue phenomenological reflections on embodiment and moving image culture with conceptualizations of enfleshment as a mode of power and capture but also of possibilities for sensual and political refusal. <br><br>

Fleshing out the Image investigates the sensorial engagement with visual-sonic worlds as “fleshed out”, as grounded in embodied experiences “of material enworldedness, orientation, movement, seeing, hearing, and reflection”, as film theorist Vivian Sobchack suggests. Inspired by thinkers such as Hortense Spillers, Alexander Ghedi Weheliye, Amber Jamilla Musser and Tina Campt, the project explores the politics of sensorial engagement by foregrounding the flesh as a site of both violence and possibility, as an experience that objectifies but also potentially conjures political imaginaries of refusal and adjacency, an experience of being-with which is accessible through the sensual. <br><br>

<i>Fleshing out the Image</I> thus inquires into the visual-sonic experience as both embodied and embodying, as grounded in the multisensoriality of the embodied encounter with cinematic technologies, and as constitutive of bodies, subjects and ethical orientations. <br><br>

The programme consists of an artistic and curatorial residency in Porto; the exhibition project “Chamber”, on view at the Carlos Alberto Chapel in Porto; and a lecture series entitled “Fleshing out the Image: Pleasure and Refusal in Contemporary Aesthetics” which will be made available on this website throughout November and December 2020. Speakers in the series include Tina Campt, Alexander Ghedi Weheliye, Amber Jamilla Musser, Tavia Nyong’o, Zakiyyah Iman Jackson and Denise Ferreira da Silva.
